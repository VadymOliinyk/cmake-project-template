This is my CMake C++ project template, that adjusts some default compiler flags to what I want to have (for Clang, MSVC and GCC). Links to a library via `add_subdirectory()`.

Redefine `MyNewApp` to your project name, and change it in .github\workflows\CI.yml (if you want to). Add or remove submodules as necessary.
